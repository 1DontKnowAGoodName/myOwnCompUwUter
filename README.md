PLEASE, it would be nice if you read this first.

IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL OF YOU TO NOT LOOK AT THE OLDER COMMITS, i never planned on sharing it so there are some cusswords in it,
in addition, this is my first time actually using git, so it's not like i was using it well, which means that i did some stupid or silly things, and i don't feel like getting roasted for these things.

this is my first time making anything for a CPU, so it's not good.
but am i proud of this thing? yes, kinda. there is still some silly things i did. (the isDL and retDL is something i regret now but i'm too lazy to actually make it better)
i also learned a ton from this so even if the assembler is bad, i have gained something.
i basically watched mattbatwings's video on assembly programming and took all the things i thought made sense and put it in

So this repo is a collection of everything i am making for my assembler. 
The assembler assembles my assembly language, which is almost fully copied from other people.
Eventually i will implement this into my CPU that i am designing. (not a very good one, and i'm not doing every part of it)
The excel sheet shows what the mnemonic will assemble to and what parameters it will take, in the format that i stole from other people too.
The logisim.circ is my circuit made in logisim so far, it's not awesome but good enough for a first time.

If you wanna take it go ahead. it's not like you can do much with it, you'll probably even get a bad grade if you showed this to a teacher, but take it and call it your own if you want.
My sources are: mattbatwings and his series, the ORE discord server, crash course computer science and watching a lot of youtube about this.
I only know very basic C++ so i still have to use learncpp.com and cppreference.com to actually get to know the functions.
if you wanna run it you need an in- and output file that has the same name as in the code and the name is really funky so i'm not editing system txt files or something. (i know i don't have to worry about that, it's a principle thing now)
