So this repo is a collection of everything i am making for my assembler. 
The assembler assembles my assembly language, which is almost fully copied from other people. 
Eventually i will implement this into my CPU that i am designing.
The excel sheet shows what the mnemonic will assemble to and what parameters it will take.
The logisim.circ is my circuit made inlogisim so far, it's not awesome but good enough for a first time.

If you wanna take it go ahead. it's not like you can do much with it, you'll probably even get a bad grade if you showed this to a teacher, but take it and call it your own if you want.
My sources are: mattbatwings and his series, the ORE discord server, crash course computer science and watching a lot of youtube about this.
I only know very basic C++ so i still have to use learncpp.com and cppreference.com to actually get to know the functions.
if you wanna run it you need an in- and output file that has the same name as in the code and the name is really funky so i'm not editing system txt files.
